# JavaScript FizzBuzz Program

### About

- A very basic FizzBuzz program
- The program iterates through the numbers 1 to a 100
- If the number is a multiple of 3 then "Fizz" is printed, if its a multiple of 5 "Buzz" is printed and if its a multiple of both "Fizz Buzz" is printed. Otherwise, if none of these conditions are met, then the number itself is printed
- Part of a series of FizzBuzz programs I have posted, all of which are following the same logic

### Run the program

- If you have Node.js installed you can run "node FizzBuzz.js" at the correct location
- You can copy and paste the code and return it inside the Chrome browser console
